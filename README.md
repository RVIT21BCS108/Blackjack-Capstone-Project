The Blackjack game is a Python console application that simulates the popular card game. In this game, the user plays against the computer. The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The game follows standard Blackjack rules, including the special handling of the Ace card and the Blackjack condition.

Gameplay Features:

1) Dealing Cards: Both the user and the computer are dealt two cards each at the start.
2) Calculating Scores: The score is calculated by summing the values of the cards in hand. Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on which value keeps the hand from going over 21.
3) User Actions: The user can choose to 'hit' (get another card) or 'stand' (end their turn).
4) Computer Actions: The computer continues to draw cards until its score is 17 or higher.
5) Result Comparison: After both the user and the computer finish their turns, their scores are compared to determine the winner.
6) Special Conditions: The game handles Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) and scores exceeding 21.
